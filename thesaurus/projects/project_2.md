## Project
For an event between SNCF and Telecom SudParis, we wanted to challenge students about the intervention. In order, to make it playful, we design a game made of questions.

## Technology used
To create this website, I simply used the PHP technology without frameworks. In terms of CSS, I used the Bootstrap framework.

## Project
The goal of this project was to design a way to surf foilboard without using a command thanks to unstable equilibrium dynamics.

### Foilboard
First of all, lets introduce foilboards, there are surfboard tune with a foil.
A foil in the maritime vocabulary is a wing placed under the water in order to generate a lift force.

### Electric foilboard
Nowaday, foils are combined with motors in order to surf without wind and waves. This enable rides over lacs for examples. 
To control the lift generated by the foil and the speed of the board, the rider uses a remote command.

### Unstable equilibrium dynamics
The idea behing this project is to get rid of the command.
The electric foilboard can be modelized by physics as an unstable equilibrium. These equilibium which has a natural tendency to vanish can be stabilized thanks to dynamics. In fact, when the foilboard begins to fall the user accelerates with command and when the foil starts to rising a little bit to much to user decelerates. 

To get rid of the command the idea is to build a sensor that decelerates

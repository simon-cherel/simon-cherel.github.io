## Project
The project proposed by the Creasila startup was to build a website that allows their customers to access to the content of the company.
Main part of the project was to design an API, a routing system and a rendering engine.

## Techologies used
To succeed, I used NodeJs and more precisely the Express library that helps build routing and API.
To manage the data and the authentication access, I used MangoDB, a NoSQL database.
Finally, to render the page and inject some information in it, I used the EJS template engine.

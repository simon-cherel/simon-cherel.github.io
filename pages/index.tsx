        <p>
          I am currently finishing my last year of engineerring class at <a href="https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/">Telecom SudParis</a>, specialised in cybersecurity.
          During the three year I passed at Telecom SudParis, I learned solid fondamental knowledge in computer science and network. 
          Before the three years spend in the engineering school, I intensively work on Mathematical and Physical fundamentals during three years in CPGE (Classe Preparatoire aux Grandes Ã‰coles), sided by strong courses on Litterature and English.
